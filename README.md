## Deployment

### Version Control

The site was created using the Visual Studio Code editor and pushed to github to the remote repository ‘Gars-Steakhouse’.

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

```git add <file>``` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

```git commit -m “commit message”``` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

```git push``` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.

### Heroku Deployment

The site was deployed to Heroku. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- Navigate to heroku and create an account
- Click the new button in the top right corner
- Select create new app
- Enter app name
- Select region and click create app
- Click the resources tab and search for Heroku Postgres
- Select hobby dev and continue
- Go to the settings tab and then click reveal config vars
- Add the following config vars:
  - SECRET_KEY: (Your secret key)
  - DATABASE_URL: (This should already exist with add on of postgres)
  - EMAIL_HOST_USER: (email address)

- Click on HTTPS
- Copy the repository link to the clipboard
- Open your IDE of choice (git must be installed for the next steps)
- Type git clone copied-git-url into the IDE terminal

The project will now have been cloned on your local machine for use.
