# Restaurant Blue Horizon
Blue Horizon Café is a fictional seaside restaurant offering a charming dining experience. This Django app provides a robust booking system for users to reserve tables and manage their bookings. Additionally, it features a review system for customers to rate and share feedback on their dining experience. The application ensures a user-friendly interface for both customers and staff to handle reservations and reviews efficiently.

### Site-Goals

The site is designed to assist restaurant staff in efficiently tracking upcoming bookings and managing capacity, allowing for easy editing and deletion as necessary.

Additionally, the site aims to offer customers a simple, hassle-free way to make reservations without the need to call the restaurant. Customers will also be able to cancel or update their bookings as needed. Furthermore, the site provides an option for customers to review the restaurant's services, enabling valuable feedback that can help improve the overall dining experience.


### Agile Planning

This project followed agile methodologies, delivering features in three evenly spaced sprints over four weeks.

Tasks were organized into user stories and prioritized as "Must have," "Should have," and "Could have." These were assigned to sprints and evaluated for complexity. Priority was given to "Must have" stories to ensure core requirements were met, followed by "Should have" and "Could have" stories if time permitted.

I created two Kanban boards using GitHub Projects: one for user stories and another specifically for tasks the developer needs to complete. These boards provide detailed information on project cards. All user stories, except documentation tasks, include acceptance criteria to clearly define completion requirements.

### Features

Navbar Description
The navbar provides a responsive navigation solution for users to access various sections of the website, ensuring an optimal experience across different devices. Here’s a detailed description of its features:

Navigation Toggle Button:

A navbar-toggler button is visible on smaller screens. It allows users to toggle the visibility of the navigation menu.
The button is styled with a custom appearance and uses Bootstrap’s built-in functionality for collapsing the navbar on mobile devices.

Menu: Always visible to all users. Highlights as the active link when the user is on the menu page.
Bookings: Shown only to logged-in users. Highlights as the active link when the user is on the bookings page.
The navbar uses authentication-based visibility for links: Register and Login are shown to non-logged-in users, while Logout is visible to logged-in users. The active link is highlighted based on the current page.
The links highlight as the active links when the user is on the page

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

```git add <file>``` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

```git commit -m “commit message”``` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

```git push``` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.

### Heroku Deployment

The site was deployed to Heroku. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- Navigate to heroku and create an account
