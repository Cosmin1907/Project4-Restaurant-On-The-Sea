### Site-Goals

The site is designed to assist restaurant staff in efficiently tracking upcoming bookings and managing capacity, allowing for easy editing and deletion as necessary.

Additionally, the site aims to offer customers a simple, hassle-free way to make reservations without the need to call the restaurant. Customers will also be able to cancel or update their bookings as needed. Furthermore, the site provides an option for customers to review the restaurant's services, enabling valuable feedback that can help improve the overall dining experience.


### Agile Planning

This project followed agile methodologies, delivering features in three evenly spaced sprints over four weeks.

Tasks were organized into user stories and prioritized as "Must have," "Should have," and "Could have." These were assigned to sprints and evaluated for complexity. Priority was given to "Must have" stories to ensure core requirements were met, followed by "Should have" and "Could have" stories if time permitted.

I created two Kanban boards using GitHub Projects: one for user stories and another specifically for tasks the developer needs to complete. These boards provide detailed information on project cards. All user stories, except documentation tasks, include acceptance criteria to clearly define completion requirements.

### Milestones

The project had 8 main milestones:

**Milestone 1 - Base Setup**

The base setup milestone covered all tasks needed for the initial setup of the application. As the foundation for the entire project, it was the first to be completed since all other features depended on it.

**Milestone 2 - Standalone Pages**

This milestone included small pages that didn't have enough tasks to warrant their own milestones. Instead of creating separate milestones for these minor features, they were grouped together under this one.

**Milestone 3 - Authentication**

This milestone focused on tasks related to registration, login, and authorization. It was crucial for securing the application, ensuring that only staff could manage bookings while regular users had restricted access.

**Milestone 4 - Booking**

This milestone included all tasks related to creating, viewing, updating, and deleting bookings. It allowed staff to manage upcoming bookings and customers to book and manage their own reservations.

**Milestone 5 - Deployment**

This milestone covered all tasks necessary for deploying the app to Heroku, ensuring the site was live for both staff and customer use.

**Milestone 6 - Review System**

The review system milestone was a last-minute addition based on the remaining development time. It involves implementing a system that allows users to provide feedback on the restaurant's services, aiming to gather customer reviews and ratings to improve service quality and user experience.

**Milestone 7 - Unit Testing**

The unit testing milestone includes the creation of unit tests to verify core functionality. These tests cover essential aspects such as template usage, redirects, form functionality, programming logic, and page display to ensure that the application performs as expected.

**Milestone 8 - Documentation**

This milestone was dedicated to documenting the software development lifecycle of the application. It aimed to provide comprehensive documentation, detailing all stages of development and necessary information for running, deploying, and using the application.

**Bookins page**

The Booking page allows users to either book a table or edit an existing reservation. If a user is logged in, they can fill out and submit a form to either make a new booking or update an existing one. The page dynamically updates the form's title and button text based on whether it's a new booking or an edit. For users who are not logged in, the page prompts them to log in to access the booking form.

**Create booking**

Users can fill out a form to make a new table reservation.

### Features Left To Implement

Next, I plan to implement an editable menu feature. This will allow staff members to manage and update the menu directly through the site, enhancing administrative control and keeping the menu current. This feature will include options for adding, editing, and deleting menu items, ensuring the content reflects the latest offerings.

### Security

Several security measures were implemented to ensure the safety and integrity of user data and application functionality:

**Class-Based View Security:**

The views use UserPassesTestMixin to restrict access, ensuring that only authorized users can perform certain actions.
Unauthenticated users are automatically denied access with a PermissionDenied response.

**Template-Based Security:**

Templates include checks using {% if user.is_authenticated %} to ensure that sensitive information and features are only accessible to authenticated users.
Additional checks like {% if user.is_staff %} are used to display staff-specific content.

**Environment Variables:**

Sensitive information such as secret keys and API keys are stored securely in env.py for local development.
In production, these variables are managed using Heroku config vars to prevent exposure of sensitive data.
These measures help protect the application from unauthorized access and ensure that sensitive information is handled securely.
